Change Log for PCRE2
--------------------

Version 10.0 xx-xxxx-2014
-------------------------

Version 10.0 is the first release of PCRE2, a revised API for the PCRE library.
Changes prior to 10.0 are logged in the ChangeLog file for the old API.

The code of the library was heavily revised as part of the new API 
implementation. Details of each and every modification were not individually 
logged. In addition to the API changes, the following changes were made:

1. The test program, now called pcre2test, was re-specified and almost 
completely re-written. Its input is not compatible with input for pcretest.

2. Patterns may start with (*NOTEMPTY) or (*NOTEMPTY_ATSTART) to set the
PCRE2_NOTEMPTY or PCRE2_NOTEMPTY_ATSTART options for every subject line that is 
matched by that pattern.

3. For the benefit of those who use PCRE2 via some other application, that is, 
not writing the function calls themselves, it is possible to check the PCRE2 
version by matching a pattern such as /(?(VERSION>=10.0)yes|no)/ against a 
string such as "yesno".
