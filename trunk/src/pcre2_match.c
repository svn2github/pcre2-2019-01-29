/*************************************************
*           Match a Regular Expression           *
*************************************************/

/* This function applies a compiled re to a subject string and picks out
portions of the string if it matches. Two elements in the vector are set for
each substring: the offsets to the start and end of the substring.

Arguments:
  context         points a PCRE2 context
  code            points to the compiled expression
  subject         points to the subject string
  length          length of subject string (may contain binary zeros)
  start_offset    where to start in the subject string
  options         option bits
  match_data      points to a match_data block 

Returns:          > 0 => success; value is the number of ovector pairs filled
                  = 0 => success, but ovector is not big enough
                   -1 => failed to match (PCRE_ERROR_NOMATCH)
                 < -1 => some kind of unexpected problem
