#/bin/sh

# Script to prepare the files for building a PCRE2 release. It does some
# processing of the documentation, detrails files, and creates pcre2.h.generic
# and config.h.generic (for use by builders who can't run ./configure).

# You must run this script before runnning "make dist". If its first argument
# is "doc", it stops after preparing the documentation. There are no other
# arguments. The script makes use of the following files:

# 132html     A Perl script that converts a .1 or .3 man page into HTML. It
#             "knows" the relevant troff constructs that are used in the PCRE2
#             man pages.

# CheckMan    A Perl script that checks man pages for typos in the mark up.

# CleanTxt    A Perl script that cleans up the output of "nroff -man" by
#             removing backspaces and other redundant text so as to produce
#             a readable .txt file.

# Detrail     A Perl script that removes trailing spaces from files.

# doc/index.html.src
#             A file that is copied as index.html into the doc/html directory
#             when the HTML documentation is built. It works like this so that
#             doc/html can be deleted and re-created from scratch.

# README & NON-AUTOTOOLS-BUILD
#             These files are copied into the doc/html directory, with .txt
#             extensions so that they can by hyperlinked from the HTML 
#             documentation, because some people just go to the HTML without
#             looking for text files.


# First, sort out the documentation. Remove pcre2demo.3 first because it won't
# pass the markup check (it is created below, using markup that none of the
# other pages use).

cd doc

# Make Text form of the documentation. It needs some mangling to make it
# tidy for online reading. Concatenate all the .3 stuff, but omit the
# individual function pages.

cat <<End >pcre2.txt
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This file contains a concatenation of the PCRE2 man pages, converted to plain
text format for ease of searching with a text editor, or for use on systems
that do not have a man page processor. The small individual files that give
synopses of each function in the library have not been included. Neither has
the pcre2demo program. There are separate text files for the pcre2grep and
pcre2test commands.

# These files are detrailed; do not detrail the test data because there may be

# those pcre[16|32]_xx files that just define COMPILE_PCRE16 and then #include the
# common file, because they aren't going to change.
